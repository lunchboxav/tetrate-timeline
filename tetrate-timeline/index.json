        "text": "<p>On 23 August, 2016, Varun Talwar launched gRPC along with the rest of his team. Google had been using a single, general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect the large number of microservices running within and across Google’s data centers for over a decade. Varun's mission: bring it to the rest of the world via open source. In August 2016, gRPC 1.0 was released. It is now used in many organizations outside of Google like Square, Netflix, CISCO, Cockroach Labs and more, to power use cases from microservices to the “last mile” of computing (mobile, web, and Internet of Things).</p><br /><a href='https://grpc.io/blog/ga-announcement/'>Read Blog Announcement</a>"

As the founding product manager, Varun once again brought this vision to life with the release of Istio 0.1. Building on experiences managing microservices at scale both inside Google and with Google's design partners, Istio made important cloud-native security, connectivity, and observability capabilities available to the whole world. Today it is used by companies ranging from financial institutions like FreddieMac to federal government organisations like the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>"
